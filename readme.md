The `Toggle` class component is designed to handle toggling functionality on web elements based on user interactions. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Initialization**:

   - When an instance of the `Toggle` class is created, it initializes with configuration options provided.
   - It sets up event listeners to listen for click events on the document.

2. **Toggle Method**:
   - The `toggle` method is triggered on a click event.
   - It checks if the clicked element is a toggle button based on the specified attribute.
   - It identifies the trigger element and retrieves the value of the specified attribute.
   - It locates the target element based on the attribute value using different approaches:
     - It can find the target element by traversing the DOM from the trigger element's parent.
     - It can also use a more direct approach by selecting the next sibling element (not advisable).
     - The recommended approach is to group the trigger and target elements within a common parent element with a class of `toggle`.
   - It toggles a specified class on the target element to show/hide it.
   - It updates the `aria-expanded` attribute of the trigger element based on the toggle state.
   - It triggers the `onToggle` callback function provided in the configuration, passing the trigger element, target element, and the toggle state as arguments.

Overall, the `Toggle` class facilitates the toggling of elements on a web page based on user interactions, providing flexibility in how the trigger and target elements are related and toggled.
